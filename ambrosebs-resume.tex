\emph{Programming language tooling developer, bringing academia to the masses.}
\\
\\
I love delivering tools and lessons from academia to working programmers.
My work in building optional type systems has been incredibly
rewarding, and fulfills a need of mine to make a real impact
on other people's lives.

My work on Typed Clojure is indicative of my approach.
I created the optional type system for Clojure
in 2011.
Each subsequent year has taken a new direction
based on the feedback of the community, using my 
expertise to match solutions to problems.
\\

I love the communicating and marketing ideas.
It is both rewarding and challenging.
I have orchestrated crowdfunding campaigns that have
collectively raised
over \$50,000 to support my goals in open source 
development---supported by companies like Cognitect, Walmart Labs, Prismatic,
and CircleCI.
\\

I have given many talks in industry and academic conferences, including
Strangeloop, Clojure Conj, Philly ETE, Lambda Jam Brisbane, Code
Mesh, ESOP, and the International Lisp Conference.
I also enjoy talking at local Clojure user groups.
